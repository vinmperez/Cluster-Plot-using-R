# clusterPlot_tutorial
This is a 'tutorial' to make a clusterPlot using ggplot2 in R.

The .png file is the final file output of this tutorial, so if you're looking to make a graph that illustrates data in that form, then this is a nice tutorial to follow. The .csv file is the data we will in this tutorial, and the .R file is the script you'll use in R. You can download all this data into 1 directory and run the .R file in R and you'll get the .png output automatically considering you have all the libraries installed. 

Thanks!

Step 1) Install R and its library ggplot2.
Step 2) Download the .R file and the .csv file.
Step 3) Open the .R file in R studio and file the script.
